TrackballScroll
===============
**Allow scrolling with a trackball without scroll wheel by using a low level mouse hook.**

Changes the behaviour of one X-Buttons or right click button (typically buttons 2, 3, 4) to
- Scrolling, i.e. vertical/horizontal mouse wheel events, when an X/right-Button is pressed and the trackball is moved vertically/horizontally
- Middle button click, when an X-Button is pressed and released without trackball movement

###### Requirements
- A trackball or mouse
- A Microsoft Windows x64 operating system with .NET 4.5.2

This software has been tested with a *Logitech Marble Trackball*(tm) and *Microsoft Windows 10*.

###### Download the latest release
https://github.com/Seelge/TrackballScroll/releases/latest

###### Run the program
- Execute `TrackballScroll.exe`, no installation is necessary.
- Configuration options are available using right click on the icon in the systray (the icons next to the clock).
- When using this program with a driver software that allows customization of the button behavior, make sure to set the X-Buttons to default behavior. E.g. with a *Logitech Trackman Marble*, make sure to set the buttons 3 and 4 to `default` button behaviour and not `back`/`Universal Scroll`.
- The lines scrolled per wheel event are determined by the *Microsoft Windows* mouse wheel settings.

###### Compile the source code
- Clone the repository from the github page or download the latest source code archive
- Open the solution with *Microsoft Visual Studio 2017*.
- Change the build type to `Release`. The program works in both 64 and 32 bit programs.
- Build the solution
